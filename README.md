# ðŸ“Š Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the **Data Analysis with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.  
It visualizes time series data of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp forum between **May 2016** and **December 2019**.

## ðŸ§  Project Description

The goal of this project is to clean and visualize data using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**.

Three types of plots are generated:

1. **Line Plot** â€” shows page view trends over time.
2. **Bar Plot** â€” shows average monthly page views grouped by year.
3. **Box Plots** â€” show year-wise trends and month-wise seasonality.

All figures are saved as:
- `line_plot.png`
- `bar_plot.png`
- `box_plot.png`
